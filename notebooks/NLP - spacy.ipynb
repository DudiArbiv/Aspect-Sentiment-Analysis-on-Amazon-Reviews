       "['[[VIDEOID:ca7421903fd1ad5c64ae1dc42a160649]] Earbuds have always been an issue for me. Mine is one of those stereotypical stories -- I can\\'t find a pair that fits my ears well. I\\'ve tried so many types of earbuds and most of them give my ear canals some sort of fatigue. It\\'s not that they sound bad, just that keeping them in my ears for more than 10 minutes is painful. The only ones I could tolerate were the Apple EarPods, and I have a love/hate relationship with them. Sure, they sit nicely in my ears, but them being fully open means I lose my music to the crickets of night and pelicans of day. Well, no more! I found the Flare R2A in-ear monitors, and seems my fear of earbuds is over.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />The R2s began their life on Kickstarter with a campaign that raised over $170,000. That\\'s quite a lot for IEMs, which are a rather niche market. Flare is a British company that strives for excellence in sound, and hopes that the world can join them in this pursuit. Before the R2s, the company made loudspeakers, so in-ears is a bit of a different industry. I think they did a fine job of things.<br /><br />I listen to a lot of different genres of music, but mostly folk and dream pop lately. To test out the R2s, I listened to hip-hop, jazz, EDM, instrumental guitar and piano, rock, classical, and of course the aforementioned folk. They performed consistently well in every genre. They also look great.<br /><br />First, of course, the sound. These IEMs aren\\'t active noise canceling or anything fancy, which is good because noise canceling often diminishes the sound quality. The R2s are still great for keeping outside noises to a minimum. They use the same plushy foam tips as earplugs, which makes for a comfortable and quiet listening environment. I tried them at work, in the bus, walking down a busy road, and even in a studio while recording. There\\'s absolutely no sound leakage at all, which is great for quiet environments, and none of the quality seems to be lost when the environment is noisy.<br /><br />People sometimes rant about flat response and how it\\'s better than everything else. Those people might be troubled by the R2s. They\\'re warmer than most earbuds, but don\\'t have muddy bass. The main issue with earbuds is always treble: there\\'s way too much of it everywhere. Then Skullcandy wanted to have fun so they started adding a bunch of bass to the mix. Everything above 80Hz seemed to have been lost. The R2s have none of those problems -- highs are crisp, mids cut through well, and the lows of course deliver the much-needed punch, rather than a drone. The responsiveness of everything is very tight.<br /><br />As I said before, everything I listened to with these IEMs sounded wonderful. They revealed details in songs that I didn\\'t know were there, while also being comfortable, affordable, and easy to use. The highs were not overbearing, but pronounced; the high-mids don\\'t clutter the highs at all; the low-mids keep all the bass lines in check; and the lows make sure you remember that the bass drum exists without making you forget about the guitars in the mid-range. That\\'s a great achievement. I really love the way these sound. Everything is balanced. Overall, it\\'s a bit warm, but I would much rather it be warm than sound like tinny old Apple earbuds from the early 2000s, with their mesh and bass-less muddle.<br /><br />On to the design. These things are beautifully minimal, but aren\\'t trying to be artistic, which is nice for a change. The earbuds themselves are black (or whatever color you chose), and the tips and cable match that. There\\'s also a rectangular machined aluminum box that splits the stereo signal for the left and right channels. It doesn\\'t need to be as big as it is, but it does add some pizzazz to things. Lastly, there\\'s the 3.5mm connector, which on mine is black with two gold stripes running through it.<br /><br />I love the design, but there\\'s one ergonomic inconsistency: The aluminum box. It looks cool, and I can see why the designer would have put it there. However, if you want to use these as a versatile pair of IEMs, you may walk with them once in a while, or just move around a bit. The latter is inevitable, and when you do choose to move around you\\'ll hear some strange thudding sounds. That\\'s the box attempting to defy gravity. Every time I hear this I tell myself it\\'s cool to look at, but doesn\\'t need to be so heavy and certainly doesn\\'t add any special functionality. The heaviness, I suppose, adds value to the IEMs. I would just prefer it wasn\\'t here, especially when I\\'m using these to perform.<br /><br />While these are \\\\\\\\\"reference\\\\\\\\\" series -- at least according to the marketing by Flare -- I don\\'t recommend using them for referencing. The R2s don\\'t produce a completely flat sound like Sonys do. They\\'re amazing for listening to, but not necessarily for studio work. I tried mixing a few song using them just for fun, and I noticed that most of my mixes tended to lose the low-mid range on other speakers and headphones simply because the R2s are warm. This characteristic is great when listening to music, but not for mixing/producing it.<br /><br />If you\\'re a musician, you\\'ll find that these are great for monitoring (and thus they are named in-ear monitors). I used them to monitor my vocals and piano while recording an entire song and they worked great. The warmth helps make things less straining on the ears, and there\\'s not so much bass that I get a headache using them after a while. I also used these to monitor my synth and the rest of the band while playing live, and the foam tips isolated the sound very well.<br /><br />It\\'s worth noting that since these are in-ear monitors, there is no microphone. The aluminum block in the middle of the cable just acts as a splitter -- there\\'s no hidden microphone. At first this bugged me, because I would receive a call and forget I couldn\\'t use these headphones to talk. After a while, I just accepted it. There\\'s no reason for IEMs to have a microphone since there\\'s no way for you to use it as a talkback to your band or anything. It also goes against the way that Flare built these, which is to solely focus on recreating sound accurately, not adding more sound. Bottom line: A microphone would have been useful, but there isn\\'t one, and that shouldn\\'t be a deal breaker.<br /><br />Here\\'s the verdict: The R2s made me like earbuds again. I was considering the Shure SE215s, but these reign superior. Once they\\'re in my ears, I don\\'t feel like I need to take them out. They feel at home. Even Apple\\'s EarPods, which \\\\\\\\\"sit\\\\\\\\\" in my ears nicely, don\\'t make me forget that I\\'m listening to music through small pieces of plastic in my ears. The R2s do, and they don\\'t look ridiculous like some earbuds. My friend even told me he didn\\'t notice I was wearing them because they\\'re so small. That\\'s awesome.e the design, but there\\'s one ergonomic inconsistency: The aluminum box. It looks cool, and I can see why the designer would have put it there.
